Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS \n \l

Welcome to the MISP Threat Sharing VM.
---

IP address: \4{enp0s3}

The default host credentials are: \e{red}misp / Password1234
The default MISP credentials are: admin@admin.test / admin\e{reset}

\e{bold}If this guest is using VirtualBox, it is using VirtualBox NAT networking 
and thus the host can only communicate with the guest via the below port
forwards and not directly:\e{reset}

ssh          -> ssh -p2222  misp@127.0.0.1
MISP         -> http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and https://127.0.0.1:8443/
misp-modules -> http://127.0.0.1:1666/

If this port forwarding does not appear to work, make sure the host machine
does not already have something bound to these ports and that a firewall is
not blocking.

Please see https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#networkingmodes
for further information.
